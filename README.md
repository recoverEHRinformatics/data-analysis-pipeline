# data analysis pipeline
This repository provides a harmoinzed pipeline with a set of pre-defined fucntions designed to query, clean, and process raw data stored in PCORnet CDM format to identify COVID-19 patients and possible PASC outcomes. Please make sure to download the latest version of [recover_analysis.py](https://github.com/recoverEHRinformatics/data-analysis-pipeline/blob/main/recover_anlaysis.py) in your data analysis working directory. You then can import all the modules and pre-defined functions in your own data analysis pipeline.

You may learn more about each module and the pre-defined functions described in details by reading the notebooks [here](https://github.com/recoverEHRinformatics/data-analysis-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/). You may also refer to [implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/recoverEHRinformatics/data-analysis-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/implementation.ipynb) for a comprehensive example of a data analysis pipeline from start to finish.
